### Module: `aad/microsoft_template_group`

**Overall Assessment:**
The `aad/microsoft_template_group` module aims to provide a template for creating Azure AD groups. It correctly sets the current Terraform principal as the default owner if no other owners are specified, which is a good security practice. It also includes a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for code quality.

However, the module has several significant issues. The most critical is the **absence of a `versions.tf` file** and a **mismatch in provider declarations**: `main.tf` and the `README.md` incorrectly list `azurerm` as a required provider, while the module uses `azuread` resources. The `README.md` is auto-generated and lacks detailed explanations, especially regarding its "template" purpose and the status of commented-out features for members and dynamic membership. It also lacks `examples/` and `test/` directories, and input validation.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Create `versions.tf`:**
    *   Add a `versions.tf` file.
    *   Declare the correct `azuread` provider with version constraints (e.g., `source = "hashicorp/azuread", version = "~> 2.0"` or a specific version).
    *   Remove the `terraform { required_providers { azurerm ... } }` block from `main.tf`.
*   **Correct Provider Declarations in README:**
    *   Ensure the `README.md` accurately reflects `azuread` as the required provider, not `azurerm`.
*   **Enhance `README.md`:**
    *   Add a clear "Description" explaining the module's "template" nature, its intended use cases, and the current status of the commented-out features (dynamic membership, static members).
    *   Add a "Prerequisites" section (e.g., principals listed in `var.owners` must exist).
    *   Provide "Usage" examples.
    *   Include "Contributing" guidelines.
*   **Handle Commented-Out Features:**
    *   Either implement the dynamic membership and static members functionality (uncommenting the relevant sections in `main.tf` and `variables.tf`) or remove them if they are not planned for the near future to avoid confusion.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Add `validation` blocks to input variables like `group_name` (e.g., for length or allowed characters) and potentially `owners` and `members` if they are re-introduced (e.g., to ensure they are not empty lists if provided).
*   **Examples and Testing:**
    *   Create an `examples/` directory with usage scenarios.
    *   Create a `test/` directory with automated tests.
*   **Variable Types:**
    *   Review the use of `type = any` for `group_name`, `members`, and `owners` in `variables.tf`. Specify more concrete types (e.g., `string` for `group_name`, `list(string)` or `set(string)` for `owners` and `members` if they are object IDs) for better type safety and clarity. The README inputs table also shows `any`.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   The current output `id` refers to `azuread_group.group.object_id`. Consider renaming it to `object_id` or `group_object_id` for clarity, and ensure the description is accurate. The README output description "Ojbect ID" has a typo.Okay, I've created the audit file for `aad/microsoft_template_group`.

The next module is `acr`. I'll start by listing its files.

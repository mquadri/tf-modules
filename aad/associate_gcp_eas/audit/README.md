### Module: `aad/associate_gcp_eas`

**Overall Assessment:**
The `aad/associate_gcp_eas` module automates the assignment of pre-existing Azure AD groups to specific roles for Google Cloud service principals ("Google Cloud (GCP Lumen SSO)" and "Google Cloud (GCP Lumen Provisioning)"). It correctly uses data sources to look up the necessary AAD objects and includes version pinning for the `azuread` provider. The module structure is generally good, including a `versions.tf` and a `test/` directory with `test.tfvars`.

However, the documentation (`README.md`) is auto-generated and lacks crucial information such as prerequisites (the AAD group and GCP service principals must exist), detailed usage examples, and contribution guidelines. The specific role ID for assignment is hardcoded in `locals.tf`, which might be by design for standardization but reduces flexibility if different roles are needed. No outputs are defined, which could be useful for referencing the created assignments.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Enhance `README.md`:**
    *   Add a clear "Description" section explaining the module's purpose, what it does, and its limitations (e.g., it doesn't create the groups or service principals).
    *   Add a "Prerequisites" section detailing the objects that must exist in Azure AD before using this module.
    *   Provide "Usage" examples beyond the auto-generated inputs list.
    *   Include "Contributing" guidelines.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Create an `outputs.tf` file.
    *   Output the IDs of the created `azuread_app_role_assignment` resources for potential use by other configurations.
*   **Flexibility for Role ID:**
    *   Consider making `local.role_id_for_association` a variable with a default value if there's a common use case, but allow overrides for flexibility. If it must be fixed, explain why in the README.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Add a `validation` block to the `group_name` variable to ensure it's not an empty string, or if there are specific naming patterns to check for.
*   **Testing:**
    *   While `test.tfvars` is present, expand the `test/` directory to include actual automated tests (e.g., using a framework like Terratest or Checkov) to verify functionality and compliance.
*   **Examples:**
    *   Create an `examples/` directory with a complete, runnable example.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Although Terraform will error if data sources are not found, consider adding explicit preconditions or checks if certain assumptions about the environment (e.g., naming of Service Principals) are critical. The current fixed display names for SPs are "Google Cloud (GCP Lumen SSO)" and "Google Cloud (GCP Lumen Provisioning)". If these could change, making them variables would be better.Okay, I've created the audit file for `aad/associate_gcp_eas`.

Next module is `aad/group`. I'll start by listing its files.

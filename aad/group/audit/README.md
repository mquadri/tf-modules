### Module: `aad/group`

**Overall Assessment:**
The `aad/group` module provides a straightforward way to create Azure AD security groups with specified owners. It correctly utilizes data sources to look up owner user objects and includes essential files like `versions.tf` for provider pinning and `outputs.tf` for exposing group details. The presence of a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` indicates good practices for code formatting and documentation generation. Input validation is also present for the group name.

However, the `README.md` is auto-generated and lacks critical information such as prerequisites (e.g., that owner users must already exist in AAD), detailed usage patterns, and contribution guidelines. While `test/test.tfvars` is included, dedicated example files and more comprehensive automated tests would improve usability and reliability.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Enhance `README.md`:**
    *   Add a "Description" section detailing the module's purpose and functionality.
    *   Include a "Prerequisites" section stating that users provided in `group_owners` must exist in Azure AD.
    *   Provide comprehensive "Usage" examples in the `README.md` itself or by adding an `examples/` directory.
    *   Add "Contributing" guidelines.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Consider adding validation for the `group_owners` variable (e.g., ensure the list is not empty, or use `can(regex(...))` to check the format of UPNs if a strict pattern is expected).
*   **Examples:**
    *   Create an `examples/` directory with a complete, runnable example demonstrating the module's usage.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Expand the `test/` directory to include automated tests (e.g., using Terratest or similar frameworks) to verify that the group is created correctly and owners are assigned.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   While data source lookups will fail if users don't exist, explicitly mention this behavior and potential failure points in the README.
*   **Module Purpose Clarification:**
    *   Clarify if the module is solely for `security_enabled = true` groups or if `mail_enabled` and other group types could be options via variables in the future. Currently, `security_enabled` is hardcoded to `true`.

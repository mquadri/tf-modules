### Module: `action-groups`

**Overall Assessment:**
The `action-groups` module provides a comprehensive way to define Azure Monitor Action Groups with a wide variety of receiver types, configured through a flexible map variable (`var.action_groups`). It correctly implements mandatory tagging and offers Key Vault integration for securely sourcing webhook URIs. The module includes version pinning for providers and a functional example.

However, a critical omission is the lack of an `outputs.tf` file, meaning users cannot easily reference the created action groups' IDs or other attributes. The `README.md` is auto-generated and needs significant enhancement to explain the complex `action_groups` input structure and prerequisites for different receiver types. Additionally, while `required_providers.tf` lists `random`, `azuread`, and `azapi` providers, their direct use within this specific module is not apparent and might warrant review. Automated tests are also missing.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Create `outputs.tf`:**
    *   Add an `outputs.tf` file.
    *   Output the resource IDs and names of the created `azurerm_monitor_action_group` resources. This is essential for users to reference the action groups in other configurations (e.g., alert rules).
*   **Enhance `README.md`:**
    *   Add a detailed "Description" section explaining the module's purpose and how to effectively use the `action_groups` map variable, perhaps with a more complex example snippet.
    *   Create a thorough "Prerequisites" section detailing requirements for each type of receiver (e.g., existing Event Hub, Logic App, Function App, Key Vault secrets if used).
    *   Include "Contributing" guidelines.
*   **Standardized Tagging:**
    *   Ensure `mal_id` is included in `local.mandatory_tags` or clearly document if it's expected as part of the per-group `tags` input.
*   **Review Provider Usage:**
    *   Verify if the `random`, `azuread`, and `azapi` providers listed in `required_providers.tf` are actively used by this module. If not, remove them to simplify dependencies. The `validation` provider is used.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   While the `action_groups` map is very flexible, consider if any common, critical fields within its structure could benefit from targeted validation conditions (e.g., ensuring `name` and `short_name` are always present for each group).
*   **Add Automated Tests:**
    *   Create a `test/` directory with automated tests to validate the creation of action groups with various receiver types and ensure tags are applied correctly.
*   **Clarify Location Default:**
    *   The `location` for an action group defaults to "global" if not specified. While common, ensure this is clearly documented in the `README.md` as action groups can also be regional. The `location` variable is optional in the `action_groups` map object.

### Module: `Standard_Tags`

**Overall Assessment:**
The `Standard_Tags` module provides a foundational capability by defining a standardized set of tags for Azure resources. Its primary purpose is to ensure consistency in resource tagging, which is crucial for cost management, governance, and operational tracking. The module correctly defines variables for all tags and includes some smart defaults like `provisioned_by` and `provisioned_date`. However, it lacks several elements outlined in the Lumen Terraform Criteria, such as a comprehensive `README.md` with usage examples and contribution guidelines, a `versions.tf` for provider and Terraform version pinning, and automated tests. While its simplicity is a strength, enhancing documentation and adding version control would improve its robustness and maintainability.

**Recommendations:**
* Create a `versions.tf` file to specify required versions for Terraform and the Azure provider.
* Enhance the `README.md` to include:
    * A clear description of the module's purpose and how it's intended to be used (e.g., as a local map merged into resource tags).
    * Manual usage examples, demonstrating how to incorporate these tags into a resource block.
    * Contribution guidelines.
    * Information on the support model.
* Add input validation for critical tags if specific formats or values are expected (e.g., for `costAllocation` or `env`).
* Consider adding `mal_id` to the standard tags as per the "Standardized Tagging" best practice.
* Create an `examples/` directory with a simple usage demonstration.
* Although this module is simple, consider adding a basic test (e.g., ensuring the output map contains all expected keys) in a `test/` directory.
* Ensure outputs are defined in an `outputs.tf` file, even if it's just to output the map of tags. The current README says "No outputs" which is technically true based on file presence, but the `main.tf` effectively produces a map that is intended for output/use.
* Clarify in the documentation if this module is intended to be Azure-specific or if there's a plan for cross-CSP consistency, especially regarding the `location` variable.

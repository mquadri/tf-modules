### Module: `adh-compute-hostgroup`

**Overall Assessment:**
The `adh-compute-hostgroup` module serves as a wrapper for the `Azure/avm-res-compute-hostgroup/azurerm` AVM module, facilitating the deployment of Azure Dedicated Host Groups and their associated hosts. It correctly implements mandatory tagging (`app_id`, `environment`, `msftmigration`) and includes provider version pinning in a `providers.tf` file (though `versions.tf` or `required_providers.tf` would be more conventional). The module provides outputs from the underlying AVM module and includes a well-structured example.

However, the module lacks a `test/` directory for automated tests. The `README.md` is auto-generated and could benefit from manual additions to clarify its role as a wrapper and explain the telemetry feature inherited from the AVM module. The output descriptions in the README should also more precisely match the actual `outputs.tf` structure or explain how to derive those values from the provided `resource` map output.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Rename `providers.tf`:**
    *   Rename the `providers.tf` file in the module root to `versions.tf` or `required_providers.tf` for consistency with common Terraform module structure.
*   **Enhance `README.md`:**
    *   Add a "Description" section explaining that this module wraps the AVM dedicated host group module and its specific value-add (e.g., standardized Lumen tagging).
    *   Clarify the `enable_telemetry` variable's purpose (i.e., it controls telemetry for the underlying AVM module).
    *   Align the "Outputs" section in the README with the actual `outputs.tf`. For instance, if `dedicated_host_group_id` is a key within the `resource` map output, document how to access it.
    *   Include "Contributing" guidelines.
*   **Standardized Tagging:**
    *   Ensure `mal_id` is included in `local.mandatory_tags` or clearly document if it's expected as part of the main `var.tags` input.
*   **Add Automated Tests:**
    *   Create a `test/` directory with automated tests to validate the deployment of a dedicated host group and hosts, and to ensure tags are applied correctly.
*   **Clarify AVM Module Version:**
    *   The `main.tf` hardcodes `version = "0.1.2"` for the AVM module. Consider making this a variable if users might need to control the AVM module version, or regularly update it as new AVM module versions are released. Keep it pinned for stability if that's the intent.
*   **Variable Naming in Examples:**
    *   The example `main.tf` passes `var.app_id`, `var.msftmigration`, `var.environment` directly to the module invocation. This is redundant as these are already defined as variables within the module itself and used to construct `local.mandatory_tags`. The example should only pass `var.tags` for custom tags, and the module itself will handle merging with its defined mandatory tags. Remove these redundant variable assignments from the example's module block. (Note: This was observed by checking the example `main.tf` which passes these variables to the module block, and the module's own `variables.tf` which also defines them). The module's `main.tf` *only* uses its own `var.app_id`, `var.environment`, `var.msftmigration` for `local.mandatory_tags`, it does not use any similarly named variables passed in from the example for its `local.mandatory_tags` block.Okay, I've created the audit file for `adh-compute-hostgroup`.

I will now proceed to the next module, `ai-search`.

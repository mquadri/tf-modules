### Module: `ai-search`

**Overall Assessment:**
The `ai-search` module wraps the official Azure AVM module (`Azure/avm-res-search-searchservice/azurerm`) to deploy Azure AI Search services. It allows for configuring multiple search instances through a map variable (`var.search_service`) and applies mandatory Lumen tags. The module includes provider version pinning (in `providers.tf`) and provides comprehensive outputs from the underlying AVM module. A well-structured example is also included.

The primary issue is that the `README.md` is the documentation for the AVM module it wraps, not for this specific wrapper module. This means it doesn't accurately describe the wrapper's input structure (e.g., `var.search_service` map) or its role in applying standardized tags. The `providers.tf` filename is unconventional, and automated tests are missing.

**Recommendations:**
*   **Create a Module-Specific `README.md`:**
    *   Replace or supplement the current AVM-specific `README.md` with documentation tailored to this wrapper module.
    *   Clearly describe the module's purpose as a wrapper, the structure of the `var.search_service` input map, and how mandatory tags (`app_id`, `environment`, `msftmigration`) are applied.
    *   List any prerequisites for advanced features (e.g., Key Vault for CMK).
    *   Include "Contributing" guidelines.
*   **Rename `providers.tf`:**
    *   Rename the `providers.tf` file in the module root to `versions.tf` or `required_providers.tf` for consistency with standard Terraform module structure.
*   **Standardized Tagging:**
    *   Ensure `mal_id` is included in `local.mandatory_tags` or clearly document if it's expected as part of the per-service `tags` input within the `var.search_service` map.
*   **Add Automated Tests:**
    *   Create a `test/` directory with automated tests to validate the deployment of an AI Search service and ensure tags, private endpoints, and other key configurations are applied correctly.
*   **Clarify AVM Module Version:**
    *   The `main.tf` hardcodes `version = "0.1.3"` for the AVM module. Consider making this a variable if users need to control the AVM module version, or regularly update it. Pinning is good for stability if that's the intent.
*   **Review Example Variable Passing:**
    *   Similar to other wrapper modules, the example `main.tf` passes `var.app_id`, `var.msftmigration`, `var.environment` to the module block. This is redundant as these are already defined as variables within the module and used for `local.mandatory_tags`. The example should primarily pass the `search_service` map and custom tags via the `tags` field within that map. The module itself handles merging with its defined mandatory tags.
*   **Sensitivity of Outputs:**
    *   The `resource` output in `outputs.tf` is marked as `sensitive = true`. Confirm if all attributes of the AI Search service resource are indeed sensitive. If not, consider outputting specific, non-sensitive attributes directly and keeping the full resource output sensitive if necessary. The AVM module itself may have more granular outputs that could be exposed.

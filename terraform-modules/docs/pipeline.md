# Jenkins Pipeline Design

[[_TOC_]]

## Overview

The design goal of the azure terraform jenkins pipeline template is to perform automated API driven infrastructure provisioning orchestration. We follow a standard CI/CD process in which a terraform build/plan is created as a package, validated, and serves as the artifact for a deployment pipeline.

# Module Name: vm (Lumen Audit Compliant)

## Description

[To be filled: Provide a detailed description of the Virtual Machine module, its capabilities, and common use cases. Explain what type of VMs it can create (Linux, Windows), supported features like extensions, data disks, networking configurations, identity, etc.]

This module provisions Azure Virtual Machines along with their associated resources such as network interfaces and disks.

## Prerequisites

- [To be filled: List any Azure resources or configurations that must exist before using this module, e.g., Resource Group, VNet/Subnet, Key Vault for secrets, specific RBAC permissions for the deploying principal.]
- Terraform v1.0.0 or later.
- Azure Provider configured.

## Usage

```terraform
module "vm_example" {
  source = "<path_to_this_module>" // Or your module source

  // Required variables (example, actual required vars depend on module implementation)
  // resource_group_name = "my-rg"
  // location            = "eastus"
  // name                = "mylinuxvm"
  // appid               = "APP001" // Corresponds to var.appid
  // env                 = "DEV"    // Corresponds to var.env
  // mal_id              = "MAL00123"
  // virtual_machine_size = "Standard_DS1_v2"
  // admin_username      = "lmnadmin"
  // subnet_id           = "/subscriptions/xxxx/resourceGroups/my-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/my-vnet/subnets/my-subnet"
  // ... other necessary variables from vm/variables*.tf ...
}
```

## Variables

| Name   | Description                                                                 | Type        | Default | Required   |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------|:----------:|
| mal_id | MAL ID for resource tagging. This ID is used to associate resources with a specific MAL request. | `string`    | `null`  | no (should be yes, to be updated in variables.tf) |
| tags   | A map of tags to assign to the resources created by the module.             | `map(string)` | `{}`    | no         |
| ...    | [To be filled: Summarize other key input variables from vm/variables.tf, vm/variables.networking.tf, vm/variables.vm.tf, vm/variables.rsv.tf. Due to the distributed nature of variables in this module, refer to those files for a complete list.] |             |         |            |

*Note: `mal_id` should ideally be a required variable without a default. The `tags` variable allows for custom tags which will be merged with standard Lumen tags.*

## Outputs

| Name   | Description                                                                 |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ...    | [To be filled: Summarize key module outputs from vm/outputs.tf, e.g., vm_id, primary_nic_id, public_ip_address] |

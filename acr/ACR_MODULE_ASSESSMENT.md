   - Fixed unused variables warnings
   - Improved variable validations

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Added network rule set configurations
   - Added content trust policy support
   - Added quarantine policy support
   - Added support for encryption with Key Vault
   - Set secure defaults (public network access disabled by default)

3. **Feature Extensibility**

   - Show integration with Azure RBAC module

5. **Maintenance Processes**
   - Set up regular updates for the AVM module version
   - Create a versioning strategy for the module
   - Set up automated quality checks in the CI/CD pipeline

## Tools Used for Assessment
- Terraform fmt for code formatting
- TFLint for code quality and best practices
- Terraform-docs for documentation generation
- Custom quality check PowerShell script for future use

## Conclusion
The ACR module now follows the Azure Terraform Module Catalog Criterion with improved security, extensibility, and documentation. It offers a flexible and secure way to deploy Azure Container Registry instances while maintaining Lumen's standards and best practices.

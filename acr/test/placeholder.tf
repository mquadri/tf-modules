// Placeholder for ACR module tests.
// Future tests could include:
// 1. Basic ACR deployment with minimal configuration.
// 2. ACR with admin user enabled/disabled.
// 3. ACR with public network access enabled/disabled.
// 4. ACR with private endpoint configuration.
// 5. ACR with geo-replications (Premium SKU).
// 6. Validation of tagging.
// Consider using Terratest (Go) for more comprehensive integration tests.
